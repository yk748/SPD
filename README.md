Stress Period Detection (SPD) is a data-driven algorithm that detects the emotional stressful periods using passively sensed measures and emotional stress levels and related feelings (arousal and valence in our context) collected from smartphones.  A fully functioning package is under development and is expected to be released soon. The corresponding manuscript is [Kim, Basu, and Samprit (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10558).
